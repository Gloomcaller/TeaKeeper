# TeeKeeper TODO:
- Home page needs to be an actual home page, not just tests.
- Site currently works only for 2025, it should support all years.
- About and Contact pages are useless and should be removed/dispersed into other pages.
- There is an extra table in the DB that needs to be reviewed/removed.
- Header should have links.
- Remove Quick Nav.
- Add blank/default CSV loader.
- Add favicon and logo.
- Tee table doesn't have an Add button.
- Reset should ask the user if they want DDefault or Blank CSV.
- In the calendar, dates that have tees should be buttons and generate a small table below to show all tees from that date.
- Site isn't optimized for mobile/tablet devices and small screens.
- Need to test the limits of ctype validation on tee brands and other string entry code.
